# Case Files

Included is a v1 and v2.
Both are meant to be a single piece for the case and are based on the Bakeneko 60%.
The goal was to eliminate the use of a daughterboard and use the more traditional left side usb port found on most gh60 pcbs.

Both v1 and v2 should be able to be machined, v1 having a prototype both machined and 3D printed.
## V2 IS *NOT* TO BE 3D PRINTED

I *HIGHLY* recommend using gmk pcb mount clip ins for spacebar and backspace
