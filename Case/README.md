# Case Files

Included is a CNC and a 3D printable version of the board.
Both are meant to be a single piece for the case and are based on the Bakeneko 60%.

NOTE THE 3D PRINTED VERSION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE CNC VERSION, BUT CAN BE MACHINED
## THE CNC VERSION IS *NOT* TO BE 3D PRINTED

For the 3D Printed version, it uses a [Unified Daughterboard](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard).
The non-JST 3D printed version is not tested for alignment.

The printed version also has a JST cable hider if you want to use that.
