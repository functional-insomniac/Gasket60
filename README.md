## 60% Gasket Board w/ Unikorn Mount


This board is designed to be a cheap 60% board with a relatively even typing feel and is greatly inspired by the Unikorn and OTD 356 Mini.

The board builds on the files created by kkatano and the [bakeneko-60](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60) and has the standoff mounting points for the H60 by Hineybush.

It uses an O-Ring gasket mount and standard 60% plates.
